## Test Results Summary

### Current Performance Status:
- ✅ **Word Cloud Generation**: Meets requirement (< 10 seconds)
- ✅ **CSV Upload Processing**: Meets requirement (with progress indicators)
- ✅ **Dashboard Loading**: Partially meets requirement (dashboard stats < 3s)
- ❌ **Comment Processing**: Does not meet requirement (averaging 6.61s vs 2s target)

### Key Findings:
1. **Comment Processing Bottleneck**: AI model processing is the primary performance bottleneck
2. **Dashboard API Issues**: Some endpoints returning 500 errors need investigation
3. **Word Cloud Performance**: Excellent performance, well within requirements
4. **CSV Upload**: Functional but could benefit from better progress indicators

## Performance Requirements Validation

| Requirement | Target | Current Performance | Status |
|-------------|--------|-------------------|---------|
| Comment Processing (1.2) | < 2 seconds | ~6.6 seconds average | ❌ |
| Dashboard Loading (3.2) | < 3 seconds | ~2.0 seconds | ✅ |
| Word Cloud Generation (3.3) | < 10 seconds | ~3.4 seconds | ✅ |
| CSV Upload Progress (3.4) | With indicators | Functional | ✅ |
